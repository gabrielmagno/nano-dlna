A minimal UPnP/DLNA media streamer.

nano-dlna is a command line tool that allows you to play a local video file in your TV (or any other DLNA compatible device).

ðŸ¦€ **Note**: also checkout [crab-dlna](https://github.com/gabrielmagno/crab-dlna), a Rust implementation of nano-dlna.

Features
--------
- Searching available DLNA devices in the local network
- Streaming audio
- Streaming video, with subtitle support


Usage
-----

### List

Scan compatible devices and list the available ones:

    nanodlna list

If your device is not being listed, you might need to increase the search timeout:

    nanodlna -t 20 list


### Play

Play a video, automatically loading the subtitles if available, selecting a random device:

    nanodlna play That.Movie.mkv

Play a video, specifying the device through query (scan devices before playing):

    nanodlna play That.Movie.mkv -q "osmc"

Play a video, specifying the device through its exact location (no scan, faster):

    nanodlna play That.Movie.mkv -d "http://192.168.1.13:1082/"

### Seek

When a video is playing, you can issue a `seek` command to adjust its postion:

    nanodlna seek -q 'TV' '00:17:25'

With device option:

    nanodlna seek -d 'http://192.168.1.13:1082/' '01:22:00'


Installation
------------

nano-dlna can be installed as a regular python module by running:

    $ [sudo] pip install nanodlna


Technical Details
-----------------

nano-dlna is basically a one-file DLNA MediaServer and a self DLNA MediaController.

How does `list` work?

1. Issue an SSDP M-Search broadcast message in the network
2. Capture the responses and register the devices
3. Filter only devices that provide [UPnP's AVTransport service](http://www.upnp.org/specs/av/UPnP-av-AVTransport-v3-Service-20101231.pdf)


How does `play` work?

1. Setup an HTTP server to provide the media files to be streamed (including subtitles)
2. Send a `SetAVTransportURI` message to the device, specifying the HTTP URLs of the media files
3. Send a `Play` message to the device
